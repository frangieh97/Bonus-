1)qcc -O2 turbulence.c -lm

./a.out >out64



2)animate omega64.ppm


	
3)I changed the init_grid value to 128 and changed "omega.ppm" to "omega128.ppm"

qcc -O2 turbulence.c -lm

./a.out >out128

animate omega128.ppm



4)As we increased the resolution from 64^2 to 128^2 to 256^2 the more pixels the omega.ppm file has and the more the animation becomes detailed. In addition the higher the resolution the more steps needed to get the results.
